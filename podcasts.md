Easiest is to use a podcast app and subscribe to what you're interested in.

* [The Secure Developer][Secure Developer] hosted by Guy Podjarny @guypod, the founder of [Snyk.io](https://snyk.io).
  - Called a "must" for developers https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/the-secure-developer
  - Snyk.io is a service that continually scans source code for vulnerabilites. You can add it to your Github project and include a badge in your README.

* [Security Now!][Security Now] weekly mainstream security podcast by Steve Gibson.
  - Old episodes often contain more detailed technical security info than newer ones, and are worth listening to.
  - Newer episodes spend a lot more time on security news and Steve's opinions.
  - Show notes (PDF) on Steve Gibson's site https://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm provide good summaries

* [SANS Internet Stormcast](https://isc.sans.edu/podcast.html) short daily security podcast. Very concise. 
  - Web site has show notes (html page) with links for topics covered
  - Security challenges with prizes

* Best Cybersecurity podcasts, according to 3 sources.  I omitted a few that seemed more oriented toward managers and less technical.
